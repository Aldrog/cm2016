# Task 1. Integration Methods
Write 3 integration methods:
- [x] Rectangle method
- [x] Triangle method
- [x] Simpson method

For the following function and integration borders:  
a = 2.3; b = 2.9; f(x) = 3cos(2.5x)exp(7x/4) + 5sin(0.5x)exp(3x/8) + 4  
and compare proximity for numbers of intervals from 3 to 20.
